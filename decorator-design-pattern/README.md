### Decorator design pattern use cases
1. Logging: Decorators can be used to add logging functionality to existing functions without modifying their code.

2. Caching: Decorators can be used to add caching functionality to existing functions so that the results of the function calls are stored and reused instead of recalculating them.

3. Authentication and Authorization: Decorators can be used to add authentication and authorization functionality to existing functions, to ensure that only authorized users can access the function.

4. Error Handling: Decorators can be used to add error handling functionality to existing functions, to handle and log errors that occur during the execution of the function.

5. Performance Monitoring: Decorators can be used to add performance monitoring functionality to existing functions, to track the execution time and resource usage of the function.

6. Input validation: Decorators can be used to add input validation functionality to existing functions, to ensure that the input passed to the function is valid and meets certain requirements.

7. Resource Management: Decorators can be used to add resource management functionality to existing functions, to acquire and release resources needed by the function.

8. Retry logic: Decorators can be used to add retry logic functionality to existing functions, to automatically retry the function in case of failures.

9. Auditing: Decorators can be used to add auditing functionality to existing functions, to record information about the function calls for compliance or tracking purposes.

10. Compression and Encryption: Decorators can be used to add compression and encryption functionality to existing functions, to compress or encrypt the data passed to or returned by the function.
